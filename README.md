### Abstract
In order to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, we chose three data sets containing regional data and analyzed them. The data sets we chose contained information about housing costs, playground equipment, and police arrest. We believe that these three metrics were a good representation of a variety of important factors. Unique scoring systems were defined for the data in each data set, in order to assign a score to each individual neighborhoods. The scores for each data set 
were then normalized  to values between 0 and 1 and combined with equal weighting to determine the neighborhood with the highest score. The neighborhood with the highest score was then declared the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. After all of our calculations, we found that Squirrel Hill South is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
