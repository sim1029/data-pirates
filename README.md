### Abstract
In order to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, we chose three data sets containing regional data and analyzed them. Metrics were defined for each data set, in order to associate scores with individual neighborhoods. These scores were then normalized and combined with equal weight to determine the neighborhood with the highest score. The neighborhood with the highest score was then declared the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
